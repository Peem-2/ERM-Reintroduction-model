# Grey wolf and Eurasian lynx Reintroduction Model for Deer Management in Cairngorm National Park

This model is made to evaluate potential reintroduction of 2 apex predator species, Grey wolf and Eurasian lynx to control overpopulated deers in the Cairngorm National Park.

## Repository structure

- [ERM_Reintroduction_model.m](https://github.com/Peem-2/ERM-Reintroduction-model/blob/main/ERM_Reintroduction_model.m) : is a MATLAB script to set the parameter of the model and run the model as well as visualize result from the inputs.
- [Reintro.R](https://github.com/Peem-2/ERM-Reintroduction-model/blob/main/Reintro.R) : is an R script to further visualize the result from MATLAB model tables, exported as Excel files, to compare the result from each scenario.
